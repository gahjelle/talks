# üó∫Ô∏è Maps, Maps, Maps!! üó∫Ô∏è

Talk given at [Pydata Global](https://pydata.org/global2022/) on December 2, 2022


## Abstract

Everything happens somewhere! Putting your data on maps brings great insights. This will be a quick introduction to some of the tools in the Python ecosystem for working with spatial data: **Folium** for creating interactive maps, **Geopandas** for analyzing spatial data, **Contextily** for taking advantage of all the maps available on servers around the world, and **RasterIO** for working with raster data.

## Presentation

- [ [Slides] ](maps_maps_maps.ipynb)
- [ [Code] ](maps_maps_maps.py)

The presentation was done in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) using the [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/) extension. RISE adds the power of running Python code to your presentations.

You can see the examples from the presentation in the [Notebook](maps_maps_maps.ipynb). Some examples are based on a data file also available in this repo.

The presentation has also been converted to a plain [Python file](maps_maps_maps.py) using the excellent [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/) tool.

## Data files

- **Countries Shapefile**: Downloaded from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/).
- **Digital Surface Model**: Downloaded from [H√∏ydedata](https://hoydedata.no/)
- **Holmenkollen arena, polygon**: Manually drawn at [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/#map=16/59.9637/10.6728)
