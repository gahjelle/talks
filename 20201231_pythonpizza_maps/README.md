# üó∫Ô∏è Maps, Maps, Maps!! üó∫Ô∏è

Talk given at [Python Pizza üçï New Year's Party](https://hamburg.python.pizza/) on December 31, 2020


## Abstract

Everything happens somewhere! Putting your data on maps brings great insights. This will be a quick introduction to some of the tools in the Python ecosystem for working with spatial data: **Folium** for creating interactive maps, **Geopandas** for analysing spatial data, and **Contextily** for taking advantage of all the maps available on servers around the world.

## Presentation

- [ [Slides] ](maps_maps_maps.ipynb)
- [ [Code] ](maps_maps_maps.py)

The presentation was done in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) using the [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/) extension. RISE adds the power of presentations with running Python code.

You can see the examples from the presentation in the [Notebook](maps_maps_maps.ipynb). Some examples are based on a data file also available in this repo.

The presentation has also been converted to a plain [Python file](maps_maps_maps.py) using the excellent [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/) tool.

## Data files

- **Countries Shapefile**: Downloaded from [Natural Earth](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/).

## More examples

A more [detailed version](https://github.com/gahjelle/talks/tree/master/20201125_geodesidagene_python) of this talk is available in Norwegian. While the text may not be helpful to you, the code should work nicely. It shows some more features of Geopandas, as well as the **RasterIO** and **Midgard** libraries.
