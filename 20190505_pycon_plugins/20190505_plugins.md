# Agenda

- Motivation

- Example: Plotter app
    - Different data formats
    - Choosing what to plot
    - More plotting styles

- Plug-ins

---

# Motivation

Modularized code:

- is **less complex**
^
- is **easier to maintain and test**
^
- is **easier to extend**
^

With plug-ins, your app:

- can be **controlled by configuration settings**
^
- can be **extended and customized for and by users**
^
- can be **better structured, and developed faster**

---

# Demo time

We'll build a simple **plotter app**:
^

- Command line application
- Read data from a CSV file
- Plot data in a simple line graph

---

# Decorators

A **decorator** is a function that wraps another function:

     decorated = decorator(original)

- Decorators are typically used to add some common
  functionality across many functions or methods
^
- In most cases, decorators are applied using @-syntax:

     @click.command()
     def main(file_path): 
         ...
^

-> _realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators_ <-

---

# Demo time
^

Let's expand our plotter app:
^

- Support more file formats, like JSON
- Support more kinds of plots
- Control which data to plot

---

# PyPlugs

**A simple decorator based plug-in architecture for Python**

```
 
 $ pip install pyplugs
 
```

Three levels:

- **Plug-in packages:** Directories containing files with plug-ins
- **Plug-ins:** Modules containing registered functions or classes
- **Plug-in funcs:** Several registered functions in the same file

---

# PyPlugs

**Example use cases for plug-ins:**

- **Readers** for different file formats
- **Models** for flexible calculations
- **Filters** for filtering your data
- **Writers** for storing your data in different formats
- **Notifiers** for sending you data to different devices
- **Components** for building your GUI
